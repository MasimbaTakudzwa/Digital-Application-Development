# Car Rental System Project: Digital Application Development

## Module Overview
This project is part of the **24LLP109 – Digital Application Development** module at Loughborough University London. The module focuses on developing practical software engineering skills through the implementation of a fully functional project using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and software development methodologies.

---

## Goal of the Module
The goal of this module is to:
1. **Enhance Programming Proficiency**:
   - Develop robust applications using modern programming techniques.
2. **Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Leverage OOP principles to create scalable and maintainable software.
3. **Simulate Real-World Scenarios**:
   - Solve practical problems by designing and implementing systems like a **Car Rental System**.
4. **Strengthen Debugging and Testing Skills**:
   - Utilize debugging tools and testing strategies to ensure the system's reliability.
5. **Document the Development Process**:
   - Produce a detailed report covering the project’s design, development, and evaluation.

## Knowledge Required to Implement This Project

To successfully implement the **Car Rental System**, students need to demonstrate knowledge in the following areas:

### **1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Classes, Objects, and Methods.
  - Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
- **Practical Application**:
  - Design modular systems with reusable components.
  - Create a hierarchy of classes to reflect real-world entities like customers, cars, and rental shops.

### **2. Python Programming**
- **Core Python Features**:
  - Data structures like lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
  - Control flow constructs: loops and conditionals.
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Exception handling for robust error management.
  - File handling to manage data persistence (e.g., saving rental information).
- **Command-Line Interaction**:
  - Designing user-friendly input/output for the system.

### **3. Software Design Principles**
- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - Divide functionality between classes like `Customer` and `RentalShop`.
- **Code Readability**:
  - Write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.

### **4. Algorithms**
- Implementing algorithms for:
  - Managing inventory dynamically (e.g., adding/removing cars).
  - Generating rental bills based on user input and pricing rules.
  - Sorting and searching for specific car types.

### **5. Debugging and Testing**
- **Debugging Tools**:
  - Use Python's debugging libraries (e.g., `pdb`) to identify and fix issues.
- **Testing Strategies**:
  - Test-driven development (TDD) to validate individual components.
  - Unit tests for class methods.

### **6. Software Documentation**
- **Writing Clear Documentation**:
  - Document system features and usage instructions.
  - Use Markdown to create README files for repositories.
- **Generating Reports**:
  - Write detailed technical reports analyzing the development process.

### **7. Problem-Solving Skills**
- Analyze project requirements and convert them into functional components.
- Break down complex problems into manageable programming tasks.

## Tools and Technologies Used
1. **Programming Language**: Python (3.x).
2. **Development Environment**:
   - Local IDEs: VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebooks.
   - Debugging tools: Python’s built-in debugger or IDE-integrated debugging.
3. **Version Control**:
   - Git for tracking changes and GitHub for project collaboration.
4. **Markdown**:
   - For writing project documentation and README files.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
1. Design and implement an OOP-based system.
2. Analyze and solve practical problems using computational thinking.
3. Debug, test, and document software effectively.
4. Collaborate using version control systems like Git and GitHub.

## About the Project
The project involves creating a **Car Rental System** with the following core features:
- Renting cars (Hatchbacks, Sedans, SUVs) for a specified period.
- Managing dynamic inventory for available and rented cars.
- Providing a billing system with different pricing tiers for regular and VIP customers.

The project serves as a practical demonstration of theoretical knowledge, bridging the gap between classroom learning and real-world software engineering.

   - Upload Python source files (`.py`) to the repository.
2. **Report**:
   - Submit a comprehensive analysis of the development process, named `<student_id>.pdf`.
3. **Deadline**:
   - Ensure timely submission as per module requirements.
